    <h1>About This Course</h1>

    <div class="module">
        <p>This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. While mathematical methods and theoretical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the tools and principles needed to solve both the traditional and the novel data science problems found in practice.  This course will also serve as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.</p>

	    <p>This is a required course for the Center for Data Science's <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/academics/ms-in-data-science/">Masters degree in Data Science</a>, and the course is designed for the students in this program.  Other interested students who satisfy the prerequisites are welcome to take the classs as well.  Note that this class is a continuation of <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/course-pages/ds-ga-1001-intro-data-science/">DS-GA-1001 Intro to Data Science</a>, which covers some important, fundamental data science topics that may not be explicitly covered in this class (e.g. data cleaning, cross-validation, decision trees, and sampling bias).</p>

        <p> This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the Lab Instructor, graders, and the Instructor. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, you are encouraged to <a href="https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2015/dsga1003/home">post your questions on Piazza</a>. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email <a href="mailto:team@piazza.com">team@piazza.com</a>.</p>

        <p>For registration information, please contact <a href="mailto:varsha.tiger@nyu.edu">Varsha Tiger</a>.

            <li><strong>Solid mathematical background</strong>, equivalent to a 1-semester undergraduate course in each of the following: linear algebra, multivariate calculus (primarily differential calculus), probability theory, and statistics.
            <li><strong>Python programming required</strong> for all homework assignments (not necessary for auditors)
            <li><em>Recommended:</em> Computer science background up to a "data structures and algorithms” course
            <li><em>Recommended:</em> At least one advanced, proof-based mathematics course
            <li>Some prerequisites may be waived with permission of the instructor.

        <h1>Grading</h1>
        <p><strong>Problem sets (65%) + Midterm exam (15%) + Project (20%)</strong></p>
        <p>
            Up to (2%) extra credit can be earned by answering student questions on Piazza and for positive contributions to class and lab discussions; there will be additional extra credit opportunities in the homework assignments in the form of optional problems and competitions.

            <dt><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html"><cite>Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective</cite> (Kevin P. Murphy)</a>
            <dd>This will be the required textbook for the class. It was chosen for several reasons: First, it covers an unusually broad set of topics, and it will serve you well as a reference for many topics beyond the scope of this course. Second, it is has a surprisingly extensive coverage of recent advances in the field, incorporating material that would otherwise only be availabe in research papers.  If you're a Matlab coder, there is <a href="https://github.com/probml/pmtk3">extensive software support</a>.

            <dt><a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"><cite>Elements of Statistical Learning</cite> (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)</a>
            <dd>This book is available as a free PDF, and it will serve a nice complement to Murphy's book.  Despite its popularity and the pretty pictures, this is not an easy book.  It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques that they write about.

    	    <dt><a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/"><cite>Convex Optimization</cite> (Boyd and Vandenberghe)</a>
            <dd>This book (also available as a free PDF) was an instant hit in the machine learning community when it was published in 2004.  Most of the optimization problems that we know how to solve are convex problems.  We will be making light use of this book, mostly for its coverage of Lagrangians and duality.  However, it's a good book to get familiar with, as it's very well written and it covers a lot of techniques used in more advanced machine learning literature.
